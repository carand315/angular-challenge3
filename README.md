# Create a directive to manage favorite movies

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, we want to change the `MovieItemComponent` so it doesn't need inputs/outputs to manage favorites anymore.
Instead, we want a `FavoriteDirective` to manage that feature (interacting with `FavoritesService` and toggling the icon CSS class accordingly)
In the end, the star icon HTML should look like this:

```
<span class="icon-star" [appFavorite]="movie()"></span>
```

## Requirements

- Remove the `isFavorite` input and `toggleFavorite` output from `MovieItemComponent`.
- Implement `FavoritesDirective` to handle the favorites styling and toggle feature.
  > ðŸ’¡ HINT: If you're stuck, take a look at the contents on directives in the self-guided training for the mid-level certification exam.
- Everything else should work just like it did before. The "favorites" feature should still be functional.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
